This project provides methods for addressing imbalanced datasets in classification tasks. It covers resampling techniques, such as oversampling minority classes and undersampling majority classes, and using class weighting in model training to improve performance across all classes. The project uses Scikit-Learn in Python and includes code for preprocessing, applying these techniques, and evaluating model performance.
